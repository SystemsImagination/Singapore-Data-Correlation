According to the title, it appears you have stumbled upon a repository commited to finding correlations in data from Singapore.

In this repository you will find two folders:
1. Label Scripts. This folder is committed to labeling headers and classifying biological compounds. As of now, there is a script that discretizes continuous label vectors, and a script that classifies lipids by matching their regex to a syntax detailed in the __LMSD__ database.
2. ML Scripts. This folder is committed to machine learning. As of now, there are multiple scripts for different data files, such as a GLM script for phenotype-miRNA data. There are also multiple algorithms, such as GLM, SVMs, and ANNs for phenotype-lipid data.

_More details, such as the author of the script and the usage/pre-conditions of each script, can be found in the comments of each of the scripts._
